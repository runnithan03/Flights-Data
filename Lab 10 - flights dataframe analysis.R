#preamble for 5.61
#ifelse() takes 3 arguments:
#first should be a vector of logical conditions
#second should be any vector of the same length as the first argument
#third should also be any vector of the same length as the first argument
#look at that lab for the explanation....

#example to check:
ifelse(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE),
       c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
       c(1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000))

x <- rexp(10) #gives 10 random values from the exponential distribution
#10 corresponds to the lambda in the exponential distribution...
#i.e. f(x) = lambda*e^(-lambda*x)

x <- ifelse(x > 1,
            rep(1, 10),
            x)
x
#the above replaces any values over 1 generated in x with 1
#think about it like we generate the TRUE/FALSE values via x > 1
#then we sub in 1 or x accordingly... 

#use mutate as the variable is changing!
